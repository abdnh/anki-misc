# reveal-in-file-manager

This add-on adds a "Reveal in file manager" context menu action in the editor/reviewer to open the file manager with the clicked image selected.

Should work on Windows and macOS. The add-on will instead try to open the file in any other platform supported by Anki like Linux.
